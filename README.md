This is my first project named Inventory Control.
I Started this project as a web development project for my diploma college.
The Inventory Control tells us the list of products present in the inventory in the format of table
What it does :
 -- First, it asks for a Login or Signup
 -- it can store your list of products in a database
 -- You can Add or Delete the product
 -- host it in you localhost server.

Hope You Enjoy it ...
